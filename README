This is a Rails app used for testing the AssetFingerprint plugin.  You probably do not want this repo, but maybe you want this instead:

http://github.com/eliotsykes/asset_fingerprint

To run tests: cd vendor/plugins/asset_fingerprint; rake test


Note to Eliot: 
Edit asset_fingerprint directly in this project as it is setup as a writeable git submodule.
